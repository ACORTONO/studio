## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm and trustworthy blue (#4A8FE7) to convey reliability and professionalism in the job order process.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), providing a clean and neutral backdrop that ensures legibility and minimizes distraction.
- Accent color: A subtle green (#70E0A3) for confirmation messages and to highlight important interactive elements in the application.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif, for all body text in the forms and dashboard. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for dashboard headings and key information.
- Simple, clear icons for actions like 'Save', 'Print', and navigation through the dashboard. All icons should use a single consistent weight.
- A clean, organized layout that presents the data in an easy-to-read format. Use a grid system to align forms, tables, and dashboards effectively.
- Subtle animations or transitions (e.g., fade-in effects, loading spinners) to acknowledge user actions.
