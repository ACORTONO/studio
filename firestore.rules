/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and
 * authenticated access while relaxing data validation to accelerate prototyping.
 * All write operations require a valid user. All data is organized into
 * top-level collections and subcollections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client data, where clientId is the document ID.
 * - /clients/{clientId}/jobOrders/{jobOrderId}: Stores job orders associated with clients.
 * - /expenses/{expenseId}: Stores global expense records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All write operations require an authenticated user.
 * - Listing clients and expenses is publicly available for prototyping.
 * - JobOrders are secured via client ownership and clientId denormalization.
 * - No complex data validation is performed during this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - JobOrder documents under /clients/{clientId}/jobOrders/{jobOrderId} include
 *   a `clientId` field, which is used to validate ownership without requiring
 *   additional `get()` calls to the /clients/{clientId} document.
